Project Name: Art Gallery Problem
Art Gallery is a well studied algorithm in the field of computational geometry. The problem models an art gallery as a simple polygon (with or without holes). The problem asks to find the smallest subset of vertices of V, such that each vertex of the subset has a visibility edge to every point inside the polygon.
In this repository, a common approximate approach to the Art Gallery Problem is illustrated. 

Steps
Ear Clipping Algorithm for triangulating a simple polygon P
The triangulated polygon is represented as a chordal graph
Every chordal graph is 3-colorable in O(N) time, where N is the number of vertices.
